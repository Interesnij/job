        "rendered": "<p>Studio Job was founded in 1998 by artist Job Smeets in the renaissance spirit, combining traditional and modern techniques to produce once-in-a-lifetime objects. Since then, the studio has gone on to grow to over 30 people and become a world leader in both art and design.</p>\n<p>In the ateliers, traditional and modern techniques are combined to produce once-in-a-lifetime objects. A vast range of crafts are practiced at Studio Job, where traditional craftsmen such as sculptors and specialists in casting bronze and making stained-glass windows work alongside experts adept in using lasers and 3D printing. Based in both in the Netherlands and Milan, Job Smeets leads as art director, artist, and designer. Technique, science and ornamental designs come together in their work as examples of what can be described as Gesamtkunstwerk – a total art work or an all embracing art form.</p>\n<p>Studio Job are pioneers of contemporary conceptual and sculptural design. The results range from unique bronze artwork in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, to a royal stamp featuring the Dutch King (forty million pieces produced) from the unique life-size bronze sculptures on Miami Beach, to the one-off Wunderkammer curiosity cabinet that Studio Job produced for Swarovski in Innsbruck.</p>\n<p>All Studio Job projects are distinguished by a love of detail, freedom of expression and blend of 2D and 3D. With more than 400 exhibitions, including solo shows, around the world Studio Job’s work can be found in many important museum collections. Their iconic, heraldic and cartoon-like sculptures are popular with collectors world-wide. Proclaimed one of the most influential design teams by the Financial Times, Studio Job are passionate about building up an oeuvre that is becoming increasingly extravagant in its details and increasingly personal.</p>\n<p>Studio Job work across many areas including art, design, fashion, architecture and interiors having worked with a vast range of high profile clients including sculptures for Swarovski, Barneys and Land Rover, and product collections for many brands such as Alessi, Moooi and Pepsi to name a few. In 2017 Studio Job teamed up with Italian manufacturer Seletti to form the joint brand BLOW producing products in their pop spirit with a radical twist.</p>\n<p>Studio Job are consistently ranked as one of the world’s most influential players within design and art. Their highly collectable work creates a bridge between object and product by merging monumental design and cutting-edge artwork.</p>\n",

At  once highly specific  and  yet  entirely  universal,  personally  expressive  and  yet  experimental, Studio  Job has crafted a body  of work that draws  upon classical, popular  and contemporary  design and highly visual and sculptural art. The work Studio Job creates is  heraldic and regal even in it's imagery. As sleek as the finished work can be, it is also instinctual  and almost primal."
